> There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. 
> 构建软件有两种方法，一种是让代码足够简单，明显没有缺陷，另外一种是让代码足够复杂，没有明显的缺陷。
> —C.A.R. Hoare, The 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture

> The computing scientist’s main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making.
> 程序员最大的挑战是不要被自己构建的复杂性搞糊涂
> — E. W. Dijkstra

> The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren’t there.
> 从来没有又便宜又快又可靠的组件
> —Gordon Bell

> One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.
> 最高效的日子是每天扔掉1000行代码的日子
> — Ken Thompson

> When in doubt, use brute force.
> 搞不定，就用最简单粗暴的方法
> —Ken Thompson

> Deleted code is debugged code.
> 被删掉的代码都是经过重重考验的好代码
> -Jeff Sickel

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it
> 调试代码是写代码难度的两倍，因此，如果你写代码的时候过于耍聪明，可能根本就无法调试
> -Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger in The Elements of Programming Style.

> The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.
> 仔细思考并添加合适的打印信息依然是最有效的调试代码手段
> -Brian W. Kernighan, in the paper Unix for Beginners (1979)

> Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.
> 控制复杂度是软件构建的本质
> -Brian Kernighan

> Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because software is so complicated. Beauty is the ultimate defence against complexity.
> 和其他技术领域相比，优雅对于计算编程非常重要，因为它是复杂度的终极守护者
> -David Gelernter

> UNIX was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things.
> UNIX不是为了阻止用户做愚蠢的事情，而是让用户无法做聪明的事情
> -Doug Gwyn

> If you’re willing to restrict the flexibility of your approach, you can almost always do something better.
> 如果你想限制方法的适用性，就说明有其他地方可以做的更好
> -John Carmack

> A data structure is just a stupid programming language.
> 数据结构就是一坨💩样的编程语言
> -R. Wm. Gosper

> The essence of XML is this: the problem it solves is not hard, and it does not solve the problem well.
> XML的精神：这个问题我们可以解决，但是不能很好的解决
> -Phil Wadler, POPL 2003

> Life is too short to run proprietary software.
> 人生苦短，不要用专利软件
> -Bdale Garbee

> I had a nightmare once in which I a had convinced a friend how wonderful C++ is. A while later he came back., and he was mad.
> 我曾经做了个噩梦，当我说服一个朋友C++怎么怎么厉害后，后来朋友回来就疯了
> —Robin Rosenberg 

> XML is like violence. Sure, it seems like a quick and easy solution at first, but then it spirals out of control into utter chaos.
> XML就像暴力，开始时候觉得又快又容易，但是很快就超出控制进入混乱

> Threads [and] signals [are] a platform-dependant trail of misery, despair, horror and madness.
> 上了平台依赖的线程和信号的道，就走在了充满痛苦，绝望，恐惧和疯癫的路上
> —Anthony Baxter [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-July/]

> Mathematicians stand on each others' shoulders and computer scientists stand on each others' toes.
> 数学家们都是站在对方的肩膀上，而那些程序员们都是站在都放的脚趾头上
> -Richard Hamming

> It’s a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, we also don’t learn from our successes.
> 软件行业真是奇怪，不会从错误中吸取教训，也不会从正确的事情继承好的经验。
> -Keith Braithwaite

> The central enemy of reliability is complexity.
> 可靠性的最大敌人是复杂度
> -Geer et al.

> Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
> 简单是可靠的先决条件
> -Edsger W. Dijkstra

> Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
> 使用代码量来评估进度就像使用重量来评估飞机的组装进度
> -Bill Gates

> First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.
> 先找到方法，然后再开始写代码
> -John Johnson
